Identifying hidden patterns and associations in large datasets using data mining techniques.

# Data Mining & Predictive Analysis (2021)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. It involves segmenting bank customers based on credit card usage and building predictive models to classify individuals based on salary levels.

## 📊 Key Problems Solved
1. **Bank Customer Segmentation (Clustering):**
   - Performed EDA and data preprocessing on credit card usage behaviors.
   - Applied **Hierarchical Clustering** and **K-Means Clustering** to identify distinct customer segments for targeted promotional offers.
   - Evaluated clusters using Silhouette scores and Elbow plots.
2. **Salary Classification (Supervised Learning):**
   - Built predictive models to determine if an individual earns more than $50k based on demographic data.
   - Implemented and compared three different algorithms:
     - **CART (Decision Tree)**
     - **Random Forest**
     - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
   - Conducted performance benchmarking using AUC-ROC curves, Sensitivity, and Precision.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Applied
* **Clustering:** K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, Dendrograms.
* **Classification:** Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Random Forest), Neural Networks (MLPClassifier).
* **Model Evaluation:** Confusion Matrix, ROC Analysis, Hyperparameter Tuning.

## 💡 2026 Perspective
Looking back at this project, I see how my documentation standards have matured:
* **Code Commenting:** Today, I would include detailed comments within the code blocks to explain the logic of specific functions, the choice of hyperparameters, and the interpretation of the model outputs, making the workflow much more transparent for collaborators.
